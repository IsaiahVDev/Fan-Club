    <h1>Welcome to the Goku fan club!</h1>
    <p>Goku, also known as Kakarot, is a Saiyan originally sent to Earth as an infant with the mission to destroy its people. However, a head injury at an early age alters his memory, ridding him of his initial destructive nature and allowing him to grow up to become Earth's greatest defender and the informal leader of the Dragon Team. Throughout his life, he trains hard and strives to be the greatest warrior possible while simultaneously being a loving husband and father. Goku's appearance in the Dragon Ball series has made him an iconic figure in popular culture.</p>
    <p>Alongside Goku are his fellow Z Fighters, who are his closest allies and friends. Together, they defend Earth from various threats and engage in epic battles. The Z Fighters include Vegeta, Piccolo, Gohan, Krillin, and many others who have played significant roles in the series.</p>
    <p>Goku's kind hearted nature and will to grow stronger has turned many of his worst enemies into his closest allies and friends.</p>
